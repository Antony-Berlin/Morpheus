Relevant literature, annual and news  reports are summarized to analyze and assess. Samsung launched the smartphone Galaxy Note 7 on 19th  August 2016. However, this product suffered multiple incidents of overheati ng or explosions around the  world due to quality problems. Before the product was removed from the market completely, it had experienced two recalls. This incident caused Samsung significant financial losses and a crisis of  consumer trust. While Samsung wa s quickly forgiven by consumers globally, the corporation has been  accused of differential treatment in China, and the resulting impact has been far -reaching. For all the  smartphone industry, it is recommended that: 1. there should be a gradual shift towar ds an open model  of innovation; 2. suppliers should be scrutinized and enhanced in design awareness; 3. a well -designed  crisis management plan should be recommended; 4. should pay more attention to the Chinese market .  Keywords: Samsung, Design Management, Business Strategy, Crisis Management   1. Introduction  In 2016, after the fall of the old mobile phone incumbents represented by Nokia, a third of the  industry's market share was captured by Samsung. It was followed closely by Apple, which held about  20% of the market. While Apple attracts consumers with its unique design and ecosystem, Samsung  occupies various market segments with a large variety and stimulates consumer desire with its rapidly  developed products. In September, Samsung launched its new flagship Note 7 ahead of Apple to capture  the premium market. However, the phone that was supposed to be a strong competitor to iPhone 7 turned  out to be a famous recall tragedy in history. Multiple explosions and two successive recalls cause massive  losses for Samsung.  The incident has lessons to learn not only for Samsung but also for the whole smartphone industry.  Therefore, this report investigates and analyses Samsung's corporate strategy, the recall process, and its  crisis management, to understand the core  causes of the explosion, discuss how such incidents can be  avoided and what the implications are for the entire business.   In this article, Samsung sometimes refers to the Samsung Group and sometimes to Samsung  Electronics Company; this distinction makes n o difference as it has no bearing on the following analysis  and discussion.   2. Analysis of the Case   2.1 The innovation   Samsung started as a low- cost manufacturer but is now a successful innovation global company and  a leader in technology. Like many other Korean companies in the 1960s and 1970s, Samsung, founded  in 1976, initially chose Japan as a reference (Freeze and Chung, 2008). After completing capital  accumulation, Samsung began to increase the status of design in the company's strategy. In 1996, Kun - hee Lee, Samsung’s chairman at that time, emphasized the importance of design and creativity in the  company’s development, and proposed a 'design revolution'. Design started to become an essential  resource for the company (Samsung, n.d). In 2005, Samsung a nnounced the ‘Milan Design Strategy’,  which marked the upgrade of design from product styling to corporate strategy. Samsung began to invest  as many resources as possible into the design to become a world first -class company (Freeze and Chung,  2008; Chung and Freeze, 2009; Samsung, n.d). Today, Samsung still puts design at the centre of its  business and uses design thinking to lead the company.   In the smartphone sector, Samsung was not a leader at first either. Only two years after Apple  ---------- Frontiers in Art Research   ISSN 2618 -1568 Vol. 5, Iss ue 11 : 1-8, DOI: 10.25236/FAR.2023.0511 01  Published by Francis Academic Press, UK   -2- revolutionized the smartphone concept in 2007, did Samsung launch their first Android smartphone GT - I7500 Galaxy (Barham, 2020). However, Samsung was growing rapidly, gaining the top one global  market share in the second half of 2013, and still today  (see Figure 1) . Samsung was able to compete  with and eventually win against Apple, because of its rapid product launches and wide product range.  Unlike Apple's single product line, Samsung has a presence in every market segment, from low- cost  phones to flagships, to control the w hole market (Yun et al., 2019). On the one hand, Samsung's huge  R&D investment and emphasis on talented designers has enabled them to have a large design team that  can support fast product development. On the other hand, Samsung takes advantage of its globalized  industrial structure, standardized products, and being a supplier itself to significantly cut costs and  thereby reduce selling prices (Simonin, 2014). Through excellent strategy and design thinking, Samsung did not eagerly capture the market with Ap ple, but steadily built on its strengths and eventually became  the industry leader.

Figure 1: Global mobile phone market share from 2010 to 2016  2.2 The incident   On 19th August 2016, Samsung released Note 7, one month before Apple’s iPhone 7. Only a few  days after the model was released, the first explosion was reported on the 24th, then one after another,  customers claimed their Note 7 overheated, caught fire, or exploded. Then on 2nd September, Samsung  started a global recall for Note 7 phones which used batteries from Samsung SDI, and repla ce them with  new phones using ATL batteries which they claimed to be safe. However, on 6th October, a newly  replaced note 7 smoked on a flight, causing passengers to be evacuated. In the following days, reports of  replacement devices overheating or catchin g fire also appeared. Finally, on 11th October, Samsung  announced to cease producing and selling of Note 7 and appealed to customers to stop using the device  (BBC, 2016). According to projections, Samsung lost a total of US$17 billion including intangible assets  such as the brand image in its worst -ever recall incident (TRT World, 2016).   Three months after the second recall, Samsung finally confirmed through its investigation that the  direct cause of the device fire was separately battery issues from the tw o suppliers (NBC, 2017). The  third -party testing company Underwriters Laboratories (UL) had tested batteries from ‘Company A and  Company B’, which are believed to be SDI and ATL (and they are referred to SDI and ATL hereafter). UL found internal short circ uits from damaged SDI batteries, while the top right corners are deformed in  some of the undamaged ones. In addition, some of the negative electrodes were too long  (see Figure 2) .  In terms of ATL batteries, some of the insulation tapes were missing, some o f the insulation was damaged  by protruding welds (Tullo, 2017)  (see Figure 3) . All of these conditions are likely to cause the battery  to short- circuit and thus overheat or even explode. This means that after the SDI -batteried phones were  recalled due to a design fault that made them prone to short circuits, Samsung replaced them with ATL  batteries that coincidentally had manufacturing issues, which still resulted in explosions. The second  recall dealt heavy damage to consumer awareness and brand image, for cing Samsung to discontinue the  production of Note 7 to reduce further losses.    ---------- Frontiers in Art Research   ISSN 2618 -1568 Vol. 5, Iss ue 11 : 1-8, DOI: 10.25236/FAR.2023.0511 01  Published by Francis Academic Press, UK   -3-   Samsung (2017) Short -circuiting causes in SDI batteries [online image].

Darbinyan (2020) concluded from analyzing Samsung's advertisements that  Samsung's target group is conscious progressive young adults. Bajaj (2017) claimed that Samsung’s  customer segments include fashionable young people, professionals, and large businesses. The research  of Lai (2018) revealed that Generation Y had forgiven Samsung and was willing to continue buying  Samsung products in the future. A survey in April 2017 showed that 89% of current Samsung custome rs  would consider purchasing another Samsung phone, while 66% of non- Samsung customers would  consider buying one (McAllister, 2018). In the smartphone sector, Samsung's market share declined significantly in 2016Q4, the time of the explosion, but recovered straight back to previous levels in  2017Q1 and Q2, when the new Galaxy S8 was launched (see Figure 4) . In conclusion, Samsung  overcame the crisis quickly and secured its position in the global market and its market share does not  seem to have changed significantly in the short term.

Figure 4: Global smartphone market share from 2016 Q1 to 2017 Q3   However, things were not the same in China. Note 7 went on sale in China on 1st September, but the  first recall on 2nd September did not include China. Samsung claimed that the ATL batteries used in the  Chinese market were safe. However, during September, there were also several Note 7 explosions in  China. During this period, Samsung recalled just over 1,800 phones in China that had been distributed  before the official launch, meaning that tho se were brought into China through informal channels and  used unsafe SDI batteries. Samsung also investigated the first exploding device in China, declaring that  the explosion was caused by external heat sources rather than the battery itself (Associated P ress, 2016;  Cook, 2016). This action was interpreted by Chinese media as unfair treatment of Chinese consumers  (Zhang, 2020). And then the ATL batteries, which Samsung insisted were safe, also exploded, making  Chinese consumers even angrier, with many seei ng this as discrimination and deception against China  (Cook, 2016). Unlike in international markets, Samsung's brand trust in China seemed to have never  recovered. Samsung's share of smartphones in China dropped sharply from 6.8% in 2016Q3 to 2.6% in  2017Q3, while the share of local Chinese phones, represented by Huawei, increased significantly  (see  Figure 5) . It could be said that Samsung has lost China, the world's largest mobile phone market (Newzoo,  2021).    ---------- Frontiers in Art Research   ISSN 2618 -1568 Vol. 5, Iss ue 11 : 1-8, DOI: 10.25236/FAR.2023.0511 01  Published by Francis Academic Press, UK   -5-   Team counterpoint (2017) Chinese smartphone market share from 2016Q1 to 2017Q3 [online image].

Figure 5: Chinese smartphone market share from 2016Q1 to 2017Q3  3. Details of Discussion   3.1 The innovation: closed or open   Samsung's innovation is manifested in multiple aspects. Saengouthay (2019) proposed that Samsung  blend the innovative mind with leadership awareness, brand culture, and economic performance. Firstly,   design thinking runs through the entire structure of the company. Samsung recruits designers in large  numbers and constantly emphasizes the importance of design in the company's strategy. Secondly,  Samsung invests heavily in R&D. Samsung's R&D investment for the fiscal year 2021 amounts to US$20.3 million (converted at the average exchange rate from KRW to USD in 2021) (Deloitte, 2022),  which is less than its main competitor Apple's US$21.9 million (Apple, 2021), but is still a significant  amount.   In terms  of the output method of innovation, although Yun et al. (2018) argued that Samsung is  typically a closed innovation (CI) company, there is also much evidence that Samsung has gone beyond  the definition of CI. The concept of CI is that the innovation proce ss takes place only within the company,  offering products and solutions through its own innovation centre. While the results of open innovation  (OI) may come from both inside and outside the company (Zapfl, 2018). However, Samsung gave up  developing its ow n operating system and adopt Android from Google, that is a clear case of external  collaboration. In addition, Samsung used acquisitions and partnerships to counteract declining profits in  2015 (Ross, 2021), this is also a solution of OI.   In conclusion, Sa msung's method of innovation has combined closed vertical integration with open  external collaboration. Also, according to the Total Quality Management theory, the primary cause of  quality problems is often inappropriate management systems and production p rocesses (Mitroff, 1994).  This means that the cause of battery quality problems may be ‘internal factors’ rather than ‘closed  innovation’. Thus, this advanced innovation model is not a contributor to the recall. Instead, after the  Note7 was completely with drawn from the market, Samsung conducted an extensive investigation and  reconsideration of its technological innovation improvements (Saengouthay, 2019), learning from this  tragedy and feeding back into the company's development.   3.2 The incident: the core  reasons   Samsung Note 7 incident is the costliest electronics recall in history (Burrows, 2018). The reasons  for this are various. Firstly, Samsung had the highest market share of smartphones at that time, and Note  7 was the company's highly regarded flags hip model. The type was costly and shipped in high volumes,  making the recall an extraordinarily costly loss. Secondly, Samsung's plan after the first recall was to  replace them with safe batteries and put them back into the market. However, the batteries that were  deemed to be safe also had quality issues, which ultimately forced Samsung to discontinue the Note 7  completely. If the batteries were replaced after the first recall was flawless, the second recall could have  been avoided, thereby significantly reducing the losses.    ---------- Frontiers in Art Research   ISSN 2618 -1568 Vol. 5, Iss ue 11 : 1-8, DOI: 10.25236/FAR.2023.0511 01  Published by Francis Academic Press, UK   -6- As analyzed previously, different quality problems existed in the batteries provided by the two  suppliers. However, these problems could have been avoided through strict quality control. Jaruzelski et  al. (2014) described Samsung as a ‘fast follower’, whose strategy development depends primarily on  external factors, such as competitor stakeholders and market demand. Based on this strategy, Samsung  continues to launch different models for various market segments to capture the market. A large number  of models and rapid development of products places a huge burden on the product department, short  R&D cycles and tight deadlines may be the reason why quality control is neglected (Yun et al., 2018).   Furthermore, if Samsung had taken more time  to test ATL batteries after the first recall to ensure they  were safe before exchanging to them, it might have avoided the second recall as well. However, as mentioned earlier, the first recall of the Note 7 was on 6th September 2016, when its target riva l, the  iPhone 7, was about to be launched. It can be surmised that Samsung likely overlooked further testing of  the ATL batteries, to place the phone on the market earlier than its competitors.   In summary, Samsung's strategic characteristics may sow the seeds of its unstrict quality supervision,  which eventually lead to an irrevocable massive recall due to the two successive quality issues.   3.3 The crisis: explicit and implicit influences   Crises are unexpected by nature, which makes it particularly important to have an appropriate crisis  response plan in place in advance (Parsons, 1996). According to the Crisis Management Model created  by Mitroff (1988), the five phases of crisis management are: 1. signal detection; 2. preparation/prevention;  3. containment/ damage limitation; 4. Recovery, and 5. learning. Samsung's crisis management failures  in the Note 7 incident were mainly on the first three points, as shown in the chart below  (see Figure 6) .  As China has a special position in this event, Samsung's global actions will be compared with those in China.     Figure 6: Crisis management of Samsung in Note 7 incident   Looking at Samsung's global response to the crisis alone, it could be argued that it has been rather  swift. Apologies were made immediately after the first explosion to reassure consumers, and the recall  was announced just a week later. However, after the explosion in China, Samsung made no apology to  Chinese consumers. The company only recalled phones from informal channels and claimed that the  explosi on was caused by an external heat source. Although Samsung did not intend to treat Chinese  consumers differently, this behaviour has attracted discontent due to the influence of distorted factual  reports in social media (Gou, 2016 cited from Zhang, 2020) t o attract attention. In particular, the implied  accusations against consumers have angered them furthermore. Samsung ignored the feelings of Chinese  consumers during the first three stages of the crisis, which led to a serious PR crisis. Since then,  Samsun g's reputation in China has been in tatters.   On the other hand, If Samsung had paid attention to the crisis signals of exploding phones in China,   ---------- Frontiers in Art Research   ISSN 2618 -1568 Vol. 5, Iss ue 11 : 1-8, DOI: 10.25236/FAR.2023.0511 01  Published by Francis Academic Press, UK   -7- and had investigated rigorously in the prevention phase, it might have been able to identify the problems  with ATL batteries. Replacing all the batteries would have delayed the re- launch and perhaps lost the  market to competitors, but it would also have avoided the devastating loss of trust and a complete stoppage of production.   In conclusion, Samsung made two mis takes in crisis management, as Parsons (1996) suggests: 1.  speculating on what they did not know, insisting on the safety of ATL batteries before retesting them; 2. blaming the consumer, even though the burning problem was indeed caused by the battery fail ure. These  reflect Samsung's poor crisis management skills and lack of clear decision -making mechanisms and  resilience. On the surface, this is a PR crisis for Samsung in China, but on a deeper level, it could have avoided the second recall and significant ly reduced economic losses.   4. Conclusion s and Recommendations   This paper analyses and discusses Samsung's innovation model, the causes of the Note 7 recall, and  the company's crisis management of this incident, ultimately coming to the following conclusio ns:  1) Samsung's innovation model was not the main cause of the recall;   2) Samsung's marketing strategy had a significant impact on the incident;   3) Samsung's poor crisis management further exacerbated the event.   More than five years have passed since the Samsung Note 7 recall. In these years, the smartphone  market has changed not much, but Chinese mobile phone manufacturers represented by Xiaomi and Huawei have gradually increased their market share. Especially after the Covid -19, Samsung's market  share ha s been on a downward trend and falling behind Apple at the end of 2021.   The pandemic has deeply changed customer life and behaviors. David et al. (2021) pointed out that  the use of smartphones can mitigate the negative effects of low socialization caused b y the pandemic and  offer psychological support. The study by Storeng and Puyvallée (2021) also showed that digital  solutions for companies and institutions for Covid- 19 can reinforce society's reliance on smartphones.  As a result, the demand for mobile phones will increase in the post -pandemic period. If t hey want to take  advantage of this growth opportunity, all smartphone manufacturers, not just Samsung, should further strengthen their design capabilities and awareness, continuously increase the share of open innovation and build unique differentiation.   In terms of product manufacturing, the supervision of suppliers and the testing of raw materials should  be strengthened to avoid serious quality problems in products. The design awareness of suppliers should be improved to prevent the production of unreason able components.   As for crisis and public relations, it is important to set up a reasonable and comprehensive crisis  response mechanism, to minimize damage when the crisis cannot be prevented.   China currently holds the largest share of the global smartphone market, with over 950 million  smartphone users in the country, almost twice as many as second -placed India (Newzoo, 2021). If  Samsung can maintain its market share of around 8% in China before the recall, it will also gain a large  number of customers. Ho wever, Samsung's mistakes have resulted in its market in China being almost  entirely split by Chinese brands. Although Samsung's global share does not appear to have decreased  significantly, it has lost what would have been a better growth potential.   References   [1] Apple Inc.

It offers a virtual work platform where  employees can securely access corporate resources  from their own device.  ---------- ENHANCED SECURITY WITH SECURECONNECT •While physical workspaces have tangible security  measures, data can still be susceptible to loss or  theft, and security breaches may happen.  •SecureConnect  significantly trumps physical security  measures by employing sophisticated methods such  as robust authentication and encryption, preventing  unauthorized access, and ensuring the safety of  corporate data.  ---------- COST -EFFECTIVENESS OF SECURECONNECT •The expense of maintaining a physical workspace (rent,  utilities, maintenance, etc.) can be significantly high and  typically fixed.  •SecureConnect  operates on a pay -as-you-go model, thereby  eliminating upfront costs and allowing flexible scaling with  demands. This results in substantial cost savings.   ---------- EFFICIENT DATA HANDLING AND COLLABORATION •In a physical environment, data sharing can be  challenging and inefficient, leading to potential  errors and inconsistencies.  •SecureConnect  offers streamlined, centralized  management of files. It enhances collaboration,  reduces redundancy, and ensures data coherence,  thereby increasing overall productivity.  ---------- SCALABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY WITH SECURECONNECT •Traditional workplaces face limitations in terms of  scalability due to physical constraints.  •SecureConnect  is remarkably scalable and flexible,  effortlessly adjusting to the needs of businesses  whether scaling up during peak times or scaling  down during lean periods.  ---------- IMPROVED USER EXPERIENCE •Physical workplaces, even with the provision of corporate  laptops, have limitations. The need to regularly connect to  secure networks, VPN hassles, restrictive access based on  location/network can inhibit productivity. • SecureConnect  goes a step further than just providing a  physical laptop. It optimizes the user experience by providing  global access to the required resources, without the need for  VPNs or other network restrictions.Employees  can work  unhindered, from any device, and anywhere, resulting in  increased productivity and job satisfaction.  ---------- THANK YOU ----------"
